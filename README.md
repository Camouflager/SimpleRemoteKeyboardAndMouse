# Simple Remote Mouse and Keyboard Web app

A simple bottle web app which allows a mobile device to connect over the local network to control the mouse and keyboard.

## Purpose

I wanted to control my raspberry pi connected to my TV with my android device, and I couldn't find a simple out-of-the-box solution that would work. This is kind of that.

## Usage

```bash
# To install pip requirements
# or you can just look inside 
# this file for the names of the 
# packages and install them yourself
# manually if you want to. I don't
# know. Some people feel weird about
# running random bash scripts that they
# found on the internet
bash install-pip-requirements.sh
# then run
python server.py

```
